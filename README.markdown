======================================

iOS classes and categories for UIAppearance and UITableView.

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, ABMTOOLBOX will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
